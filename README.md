# Konnect Ops Demo <!-- omit in toc -->

> Warning! This project is currently under active development, and all aspects are subject to change. Use at your own risk!
> Additionally, note that the demo environment has only been tested on macOS and may not function properly on Windows.

A local demo showcasing the utilization of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) for the provisioning of Konnect Resources and deployment of Kong Data Planes (DPs) within Kubernetes (K8s) environments.

The demo environment is configured with [MinIO](https://min.io/) serving as a Terraform backend, and [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) utilized for the secure storage of credentials and sensitive information.

In addition, the demo environment includes an example of Kong State file management, as part of an APIOps workflow. [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is utilized as an IDP for the example APIs OIDC configuration.

The Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process employs the execution of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) locally through the utilization of [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

## Prepare the demo environment

Download the minio client for the target runner platform architecture (e.g. linux amd64), place it into a folder (e.g. mc-binary) and export the path like this:
```bash
export MINIOCLIENT_PATH="/path-to/mc-binary"
```

To spin-up and prepare your local environment, execute: 

```bash
$ make prepare
```

When preparing the demo environment for the first time, you will be prompted
to provide your `konnect access token`, `s3 access key` and `s3 access secret`.

To get your `konnect access token`, login to your Konnect organization, navigate to the `Personal Access Tokens` page and click `Generate Token`.

![Konnect](./images/konnect_pat.png)

To create your `s3 access key` and `s3 access secret`: 
1. Open `Minio Console` at http://localhost:9000. 
2. Login using `minio-root-user`, `minio-root-password` as username and password.
3. Go to `Access Keys`
4. `Create Access Key`

## Provision Konnect resources

In this demo, there are two documented approaches for provisioning resources in Konnect.

1. **Static**: A straightforward approach where all Konnect resources are statically defined
2. **Federated**: Every team manages their own Konnect resources

### Static approach

Terraform project: `./terraform/konnect/static`

Provisioning will result in the following high level setup:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  subgraph Konnect
        direction TB; 
        subgraph Applications
            J[Developer Portal]
        end

        subgraph Teams and System Accounts
            subgraph Individual
                A[Demo CP Viewers]
                B[System Account<br>demo_cp_admin]
            end
            subgraph Platform
                C[System Account<br>global_cp_admin]
            end
        end

        subgraph Control Planes
            D[Demo_CP]
            E[Global_CP<br>Preconfigured with Terraform]
        end

        subgraph Control Plane Groups
            F[CP_Group]
        end
    end

    subgraph Managed Cluster
      direction RL
        P[Kong DP Nodes]
    end
    
    A -.-> |Read-Only| D
    B --> |Admin| D

    C -.-> |Admin| E

    D --> |API Configurations| F 
    E --> |Global Policies| F

    F --> |API Configurations & Global Policies| P
```


#### Run the Provisioning workflow

To provision the Konnect resources, execute the following command: 

```bash
$ act -W .github/workflows/provision-konnect-static.yaml 
```

***Input Parameters***

| Name        | Description                                            | Required | Default     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| action      | The action to perform. Either `provision` or `destroy` | No       | `provision` |
| environment | The environment to provision                           | No       | `dev`       |


### Federated approach (Teams onboarding + Resource Governor)

In a federated scenario, a central Platform team is responsible for managing the Konnect APIM platform and creating technical assets for individual Teams to consume.

Individual Teams can onboard to the Platform and manage their own resources using the tools provided by the Platform team.

#### Onboarding process

Prerequisite:

The platform team maintains a repository with a list of teams onboarded to the Platform.

e.g. `examples/platformops/federated/teams/teams.json`

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "format_version": "1.0.0",
        "type": "konnect.teams",
        "description": "Teams onboarded to the Konnect APIM platform"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "konnect.team",
            "name": "Kronos",
            "description": "Kronos team is building IaC services",
            "labels": {
                "TID": "KTEAM_00001"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.team",
            "name": "Tiger",
            "description": "Tiger team is building the Global Observability Platform",
            "labels": {
                "TID": "KTEAM_00002"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.team",
            "name": "Gorillaz",
            "offboarded": true,
            "description": "Gorillaz team is building the legagy services",
            "labels": {
                "TID": "KTEAM_00003"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Onboarding flow:

1. The team requests onboarding to the Platform team. This can be done either by:
  - **Filling out a form**: The team provides the required information through a designated form.
  - **Creating a pull request**: The team submits a pull request to the Platform team's repository with the necessary details.

2. The Platform team reviews the request. Upon approval, the team is added to the repository's teams list.
3. Once the list is updated, the onboarding workflow is triggered. This workflow will:
   1. Provision the team in Konnect.
   2. Provision a dedicated mount in HashiCorp Vault for the team.
   3. Create the base System Account for the team.
   4. Assign the `Control Plane` and `API Product` `Creator` role to the system account.
   5. Create token for the system account and store it securely in the teams Vault mount.
   6. Provision a **Konnect Resource Governor** Repository (ex: MyTeam_KRG) for the team. This repository will be used by the team to manage their Konnect Resources.
   7. Any other use-case specific provisioning can be added to this workflow.

```mermaid
graph LR;
  A[Team requests onboarding] -->|Filling out a form| B[Platform team reviews request];
  A -->|Creating a pull request| B;
  B -->|Approved| C[Add team to repository's teams list];
  C --> D[Trigger onboarding workflow];
  D --> E[Provision team and RBAC in Konnect];
  D --> F[Provision Team KVs];
  D --> G[Provision Konnect Resource Governor Repository];
  D --> H[Other provisioning];
```

#### Run the example Teams Onboarding workflow

```bash
act --input config=examples/platformops/federated/teams/teams.json -W .github/workflows/onboard-konnect-teams.yaml   
```

***Input Parameters***

| Name        | Description                                            | Required | Default                                      | Options                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| config      | Path to the provisioning config file                   | No       | examples/platformops/federated/teams/teams.json | -                              |

> To offboard teams, you can update your `teams.json` file by adding the `offboarded: true` flag to the teams you want to offboard and run the same workflow.

#### Resource Governor

After onboarding, the team will have access to their `Konnect Resource Governor` repository. In this repository, they will be able to define the Konnect resources they need and start consuming the APIM platform.

Example repository structure:

```plaintext
TeamName_KRG
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── provision-resources.yaml
├── resources
│   └── resources.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

Example konnect resourses files can be found at `examples/platformops/federated/teams/kronos/resources.json` & `examples/platformops/federated/teams/tiger/resources.json`

Example Kronos team `resources.json` file:

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "format_version": "1.0.0",
        "type": "konnect.team.resources",
        "region": "eu",
        "team": "Kronos",
        "description": "Kronos team Konnect resources in the EU region"
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "konnect.control_plane",
            "name": "Kronos Dev",
            "description": "Kronos development control plane",
            "labels": {
                "env": "dev"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.control_plane",
            "name": "Kronos Test",
            "description": "Kronos test control plane",
            "labels": {
                "env": "tst"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.control_plane",
            "name": "Kronos Acc",
            "description": "Kronos acceptance control plane",
            "labels": {
                "env": "acc"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.control_plane",
            "name": "Kronos Prd",
            "description": "Kronos production control plane",
            "labels": {
                "env": "prd"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.api_product",
            "name": "Flights API",
            "description": "API for managing flights",
            "labels": {},
            "public_labels": {
                "team": "kronos"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "konnect.api_product",
            "name": "Routes API",
            "description": "API for managing routes",
            "labels": {},
            "public_labels": {
                "team": "kronos"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Run the example Team Kronos Resources workflow

To provision the above resources, run the following command:

```bash
# Team Kronos resources
act --input config=examples/platformops/federated/teams/kronos/resources.json -W .github/workflows/provision-konnect-team-resources.yaml
```

For every requested resource type, the workflow will:

- Create the requested resource in Konnect, such as a Control Plane or API Product.
- Assign the `Viewer` role to the team for the requested resource.
- Provision an admin system account for the requested resource.
- Generate a token for the admin system account and store it securely in HashiCorp Vault.
- Additionally, it will create a `Konnect Config Store` for every Control Plane.

This will result in the following high level setup

```mermaid
graph TD;
  subgraph Konnect
    subgraph Teams
      A[Team Kronos]
    end

    subgraph System Accounts
      E[sa-kronos-dev-cp-admin]
      F[sa-kronos-acc-cp-admin]
      G[sa-kronos-prd-cp-admin]
      J[sa-flights-api-ap-admin]
      K[sa-routes-api-ap-admin]
    end

    subgraph API Products
      H[Flights API]
      I[Routes API]
    end

    subgraph Control Planes
      B[Kronos Dev]
      C[Kronos Acc]
      D[Kronos Prd]
    end
  end

  A --> |Viewer|B
  A --> |Viewer|C
  A --> |Viewer|D
  A --> |Viewer|H
  A --> |Viewer|I

  E --> |Admin|B
  F --> |Admin|C
  G --> |Admin|D
  J --> |Admin|H
  K --> |Admin|I

```

## Deploy the Observability stack (Optional)

Konnect provides out of the box visualization of Logs and Metrics via **Konnect Analytics**. In some cases, Kong Dataplanes may need to integrate with 3rd party observability tools for more use-case specific and fine grained observability.

This repository provides examples of how can this be accomplished using common approaches, global plugins and patterns.

**Available demo observability stacks**

The different observability stack examples included is this repo are:

1. Grafana Stack (Prometheus, Fluentbit, Loki, Tempo, Kong Dashboards)
2. Datadog Stack
3. Dynatrace Stack

### Datadog

> Make sure you have a Datadog account and a valid Datadog API key (https://www.datadoghq.com/). You can define your datadog API key in `act.secrets` as `DD_API_KEY`.

The workflow is available in `.github/workflows/deploy-observability-tools.yaml`

The workflow will configure `prometheus`, `opentelemetry` and `file-log` global plugins on the requested Control Plane 
and deploy a `Datadog Operator` on your local kind cluster.

```bash
$ act --input control_plane_name=<control_plane_name> \
   --input observability_stack=datadog \
    -W .github/workflows/deploy-observability-tools.yaml   
```

View all metrics, traces and logs in your datadog dashboards.

### Grafana

The workflow is available in `.github/workflows/deploy-observability-tools.yaml`

The workflow will configure `prometheus`, `opentelemetry` and `http-log` global plugins on the requested Control Plane 
and deploy the `Prometheus Operator` together with `Kong Grafana dashboards`, `fluentbit`, `loki` and `tempo` on your local kind cluster.

```bash
$ act --input control_plane_name=<control_plane_name> \
   --input observability_stack=grafana \
    -W .github/workflows/deploy-observability-tools.yaml   
```

Port forward Grafana to localhost:3000

In your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000

Login with `username: admin` and `password: prom-operator`.


**View Kong Metrics**

**View Logs and Traces**
![Logs and Traces](./images/grafana_loki_tempo.png)

### Dynatrace

> Make sure you have a Dynatrace account and a valid Dynatrace API key (https://www.dynatrace.com/). You can define your Dynatrace API token in `act.secrets` as `DT_API_TOKEN`.

The workflow will configure `prometheus`, `opentelemetry` and `tcp-log` global plugins on the requested Control Plane
and deploy the `otel Operator` and `Dynatrace otel collector` on your local kind cluster.

```bash
$ act --input control_plane_name=<control_plane_name> \
   --input observability_stack=dynatrace \
    -W .github/workflows/deploy-observability-tools.yaml   
```

View all metrics, traces and logs in your Dynatrace dashboards.


## Deploy Data Planes

After provisioning, you can deploy the Kong DPs to your local K8s:

```bash
$ act --input control_plane_name=<cp_name> \
      --input system_account=<system_account_access_token_name> \
      -W .github/workflows/deploy-dp.yaml
```

***Make a request to the demo API***

Make sure you can access your Kong Dataplane:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/<deployment_name>  8000:8000 -n kong
```

```curl
$ curl -u demo:<client-secret> http://localhost:8000/petstore/pets
```

To obtain the `client-secret`, follow these steps:

- Open your web browser and navigate to Keycloak (http://localhost:8080).
- Log in using the username `admin` and the password `admin`.
- Once logged in, select the `Demo realm`.
- Go to `Clients` in the left-hand menu.
- Click on the `demo` client.
- Navigate to the `Credentials` tab to find the client-secret.
